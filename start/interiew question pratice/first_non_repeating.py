'''
ðŸ”¹ Q5: Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String

Question:
Given "aabbccdeff", return "d".

Theory Used:

Requires hashing + frequency count.

Dictionaries in Python maintain insertion order (since Python 3.7).

Internal Working:

dict is implemented as a hash table with open addressing.

Counting is O(n) because lookup/update in dict is amortized O(1).
